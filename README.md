# Python-Assignment-Task
README for the TASK 3:-

First, please ensure that a MySQL server is installed on your computer and the mysql-connector-python module is installed.

You can install it using ->pip install mysql-connector-python


This Python program creates a MySQL database named mystudents and a table named students with columns student_id, first_name, last_name, age, and grade. 

It then inserts a new student record into the “students” table with the following details:

First Name: “Alice” Last Name: “Smith” Age: 18 Grade: 95.5

It updates the student's grade with the first name “Alice” to 97.0 and deletes the student with the last name “Smith.”

Finally, it fetches and displays all student records from the “students” table.
